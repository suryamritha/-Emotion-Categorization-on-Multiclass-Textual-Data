# Emotion Categorization on Multiclass Textual Data
 This study uses Natural Language Processing and extensively explores models such as SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Bagging, and Ensemble Model. The objective is to identify the most effective model for nuanced emotion classification from textual data, focusing on the WASSA dataset for a multiclass classification problem covering four emotions: anger, fear, sadness, and joy. Meticulous analysis of these algorithms delves into the intricate fabric of written language, deciphering a spectrum of emotional states. The ensemble model (SVM + XGBoost) achieves  the best  accuracy
